## mention-type

### SoMeSci

SoMesci mentions type is mono valuated among allusion, usage, creation and deposition. One mention implicitly suggest that the previous types are true eg. deposition creations means usage and creation, deposition means usage, creation and deposition …

### Softcite

Softcite uses cumulative mentions : used, created and shared. If none of them are present, it should probably match with the “Allusion” mention type of SoMeSci. If multiple types are present, probably the last one between used, created and shared should be kept.

### SoftMeScite

We should probably keep the multi valuated from Softcite and the Allusion from SoMeSci
